# 🔍 Regression Models: An Overview

This repository provides an introductory explanation of **Regression Models**, a fundamental concept in supervised machine learning used for predicting continuous outcomes. Whether you're just starting out in data science or reviewing core concepts, this guide outlines key regression techniques and their real-world applications.

## 📘 What is a Regression Model?

A **regression model** is a type of **supervised learning algorithm** designed to predict **continuous values**. It learns the relationship between one or more **independent variables (features)** and a **dependent variable (target)**.

> Example: Predicting house prices based on size, location, and number of rooms.

## 📊 Types of Regression Models

### 1. **Linear Regression**
Predicts the target using a straight line:

\[
y = mx + b
\]

- Simple and easy to interpret.
- Assumes a linear relationship between features and the target.

---

### 2. **Multiple Linear Regression**
Extension of linear regression with multiple features:

\[
y = b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + \dots + b_nx_n
\]

- Useful when the outcome depends on several variables.

---

### 3. **Polynomial Regression**
Fits a curve instead of a straight line:

\[
y = b_0 + b_1x + b_2x^2 + \dots + b_nx^n
\]

- Captures non-linear relationships.

---

### 4. **Ridge Regression**
Linear regression with **L2 regularization**:

- Penalizes large coefficients.
- Reduces overfitting.

---

### 5. **Lasso Regression**
Linear regression with **L1 regularization**:

- Encourages sparsity.
- Can eliminate irrelevant features by shrinking coefficients to zero.

---

### 6. **ElasticNet Regression**
Combines **L1** and **L2** regularization:

- Balances the strengths of Ridge and Lasso.
- Useful when dealing with many correlated features.

---

### 7. **Logistic Regression**
Despite the name, **used for classification**, not regression.

- Predicts probability of class membership.
- Outputs are categorical (e.g., 0 or 1).

---

### 8. **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**
Applies Support Vector Machine concepts to regression tasks:

- Effective in high-dimensional spaces.
- Uses margin of tolerance (epsilon) in predictions.

---

### 9. **Decision Tree Regression**
Predicts values by learning decision rules from data:

- Non-parametric and easy to visualize.
- Can capture non-linear relationships.

---

### 10. **Random Forest Regression**
Ensemble of multiple decision trees:

- Reduces overfitting.
- More accurate than individual decision trees.

---

### 11. **Gradient Boosting Regression**
Builds models sequentially to correct previous errors:

- Examples: **XGBoost**, **LightGBM**
- Often used in competitive machine learning.
