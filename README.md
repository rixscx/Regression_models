# 📊 Comprehensive Regression Models Toolkit

This repository offers a **complete exploration of regression models**—from theoretical insights to hands-on benchmarking and comparative studies using synthetic datasets. It's ideal for students, researchers, and data professionals seeking to understand the **breadth and depth of regression algorithms** in machine learning.

## 📘 What’s Inside?

This project is divided into three key notebooks:

### 1. **Types of Regression Models**
A curated guide explaining over **20 regression models**, including:

- Linear, Polynomial, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet
- Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Regression, KNN, Neural Networks
- Advanced models like XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, and more

Each model includes intuitive explanations, key formulas, and example use cases.

---

### 2. **Comparative Analysis on a Noisy Sine Wave**
Applies several regression algorithms on a **noisy sinusoidal dataset** to examine:

- How well each model fits non-linear patterns
- Model complexity vs. performance
- Visual comparisons of predicted vs. actual values

---

### 3. **Comprehensive Benchmarking on Synthetic Data**
A thorough evaluation of **24 regression models** using synthetic data with:

- 📈 Metrics: R², MSE, Cross-Validation Score
- ⏱️ Execution time
- 📊 Coefficients, Confidence Intervals, p-values
- 🧪 Advanced models: Gaussian Process, Bayesian Ridge, Huber, TheilSen, etc.
